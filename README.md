### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this Software to the develop the Pseudo Fulfillment System, a mobile plan change order handling system for a Telecom company. The system aims to streamline the process of activating new mobile plans for customers.

#### 1.2. Scope

The scope of this project includes the design and development of both the frontend and backend components. It covers the creation of a user-friendly interface, plan selection, phone number validation, SIM card activation, billing information collection, payment processing, confirmation, plan activation, and error handling.

#### 1.3. Technologies Used

The technologies used for this project are as follows:

- **Frontend Framework:** [Angular](https://angular.io)

- **Backend Framework:** [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/)

- **Database:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

- **Microservices:**[Eureka Server](https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/), [Feign Client](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/multi_spring-cloud-feign.html)

### 2. System Overview

#### 2.1. System Architecture

The Pseudo Fulfillment System follows a client-server architecture, with Angular serving as the frontend client and Spring Boot as the backend server. The system communicates with a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.

#### 2.2. User Roles

The system involves the following user roles:

- Telco Customer: End-users who want to activate a new mobile plan.

#### 2.3. Use Cases

The main use cases of the system include:

- User logs in to recharge a plan.
- User selects a mobile plan.
- User enters and validates their phone number.
- User requests a new SIM card if needed.
- User provides billing information and selects a payment method.
- System processes the payment and confirms the transaction.
- User receives a confirmation email or SMS.
- User's selected mobile plan is activated immediately upon successful payment.
- System handles errors gracefully.

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1. User Interface

The user interface should be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing customers to input the necessary information easily.

#### 3.2. Plan Selection

Customers should be able to choose from a list of available mobile plans, including details such as plan name, data limits, talk time, and pricing.

#### 3.3. Phone Number Validation

The system should validate customer phone numbers to ensure they are in the correct format (e.g., XXX-XXX-XXXX) and not already associated with another active plan.

#### 3.4. SIM Card Activation

Customers should have the option to request a new SIM card if needed or enter the SIM card number if they already have a compatible one.

#### 3.5. Billing Information

Customers must provide billing information, including their name, address, and payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal).

#### 3.6. Payment Processing

The system should process payments based on the selected plan and payment method. It should provide a clear confirmation of the payment status (success or failure).

#### 3.7. Confirmation

Upon successful payment, the customer should receive a confirmation email or SMS with details of the activated plan, billing information, and next steps.

#### 3.8. Plan Activation

The selected mobile plan should be activated immediately upon successful payment, allowing the customer to make calls, send texts, and use data with the new plan.

#### 3.9. Error Handling

The system should handle errors gracefully, including failed payments, network issues, or incorrect input data, and provide clear error messages to the customer.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 4.1. Performance

The system must perform efficiently, with quick response times, even during peak usage.

#### 4.2. Security

Security measures should be in place to protect user data and payment information.

#### 4.3. Usability

The system should be designed for ease of use, with an intuitive interface.

#### 4.4. Availability

The system should be highly available, with minimal downtime for maintenance.

#### 4.5. Scalability

The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users and mobile plans.

### 5. Testing

#### 5.1. Test Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be employed, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the application functions correctly.

#### 5.2. Test Cases

Detailed test cases will be developed to cover various scenarios, including plan selection, payment processing, error handling, and more.
